# Origin Story

The lyrics are a bit old and salty, like me. Written from scratch without AI or a GPT. I typed these lyrics into an AI, suno.ai, with the intent of it making a house beat. And it did a pretty good job.

Now I want to acutally be able to `npm install this-beat` so that's the purpose of this repo.


# Boomer Talk

If you know me, I'm a javascript disliker. Been disliking React since around version 0.12.0. I've enjoyed and got paid to work with all the other languages mentioned in the lyrics. However I think this song is pretty good.

Generally I'm also pretty pessimistic about AI and it's usefulness. For example this song. A human, me, wrote the lyrics, so they're ok. They're by no means perfect, like why would you import a token, don't hardcode your tokens kids, certainly not in an external module. The human part is not perfect.

However the AI generated part, although it goes hard, needs lots of work.

* The song cuts out at the 2 minute mark. I also ran the AI [to continue](https://app.suno.ai/song/c912984e-d789-48cb-832a-bd137ea54beb) the song but it [didn't wrap up nicely](https://app.suno.ai/song/08709b8a-299c-47bf-8e17-901136baac8b).
* The instructions were to "build up and drop for the chorus", but it builds and drops the "I'm a senior dev" line. That's not what I asked.
* It sounds like it's recording static along with the song.
* The lead singer sounds like she's saying "node module" singular.
* It didn't sing the line correct at the beginning "got to r m f my", but you need the `r` for recursive, "rm: cannot remove 'node_modules': Is a directory".
* suno.ai didn't give me the DAW files, or individual tracks to go and edit it.

It's a funny toy right now, but not actually useful. It will take more work to make this a real track than it's worth.
